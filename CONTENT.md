**Section title:** About Go7Studio

Go7Studio is a small, scrappy studio with a big love for games that feel *alive*. We obsess over the little things—snappy feedback, juicy animations, rewarding progression—because the best games don’t just look good… they *feel* good.

From mobile tycoon strategy to Roblox experiences built for chaos with friends, we design every project around one idea: **fun first**. That means easy-to-learn mechanics, smart difficulty curves, and a steady stream of goals that keep players saying, “Okay, last run… for real.”

We’re constantly experimenting, polishing, and shipping. If you’re here, you’re early—and we can’t wait to build the next hit with you.

## About Page (/about)

### Full studio story
Go7Studio started with a simple idea: make games that people can’t stop smiling about. We’ve always loved the magic of a good gameplay loop—the kind that feels instantly understandable, but keeps revealing depth the longer you play.

We’re builders by nature. We prototype fast, test constantly, and polish relentlessly. Our favorite moments are when a mechanic finally “clicks,” the game starts flowing, and players begin creating their own stories—big wins, hilarious fails, and clutch saves that get retold like legends.

Today, Go7Studio focuses on crafting mobile and Roblox experiences that blend smart progression with bold, playful energy. We’re small, but we ship like we’re hungry—because we are.

### Mission statement
**Our mission is to build fun‑first games with satisfying progression, delightful polish, and replayable worlds that players love to return to.**

### Values (core values)
- **Fun First:** If it isn’t fun in 30 seconds, we rework it.
- **Polish Matters:** Feedback, motion, and sound should feel *juicy* and rewarding.
- **Respect the Player:** Clear goals, fair systems, and progression that honors your time.
- **Ship & Improve:** Launch, learn, iterate—then make it even better.
